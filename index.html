    <div class="advantages">
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <p1>No matter the size of the business, cloud computing advantages bring the potential to transform workloads, increasing efficiency and productivity.</p1>
        <li><b>Cost Savings</b>Migrating to the cloud means less money spent up front on costly IT equipment. Likewise, technical benefits of cloud computing include the reduction of ongoing maintenance costs, IT personnel time, and rolling out upgrades. Instead, clients take advantage of the buying power and expertise of cloud providers. This leads to substantial cost savings – 80 per cent of IT teams saved money after moving to the cloud.</li>
        <li><b>Security</b>Data security is critical to business success, especially when storing sensitive information. Cloud services offer peace of mind through advanced security measures. They run state-of-the-art encryption, authentication, and security patches. Physical security is likewise improved, with data centres secured by several layers of protection.</li>
        <li><b>Flexibility</b>One of the most compelling benefits of cloud computing is its flexibility. Users select their providers, compute resources, storage space, and environments. This flexibility releases clients to create their ideal cloud setup.</li>
        <li><b>Scalability</b>Cloud environments are infinitely scalable. Companies can increase or decrease their bandwidth to cope with varying demands. Likewise, the scalability of cloud computing for businesses means cloud infrastructure grows seamlessly with your operation – never holding you back.</li>
        <li><b>Mobility</b>Cloud hosting allows users to access data from anywhere with an internet connection. In the age of smartphones, businesses can also offer their employees mobile solutions. Instead of being limited by local server access, companies can work from anywhere in the world – creating endless recruitment and growth opportunities.</li>

    <div class="disdvantages">
        <h2>Disdvantages</h2>
        <p1>Even though cloud computing has become a popular solution for businesses and individuals looking to store, manage and process their data and applications online, it is also essential to consider the potential disadvantages of cloud computing and weigh them against the benefits. Typical disadvantages of cloud computing include the following:</p1>
        <li><b>Security and Privacy </b>Evolving privacy and data security threats are additional disadvantages of cloud computing, where storing sensitive data and applications online can leave them vulnerable to cyber threats like hacking, data breaches, and malware attacks. You’d be surprised to learn that nearly 98% of businesses employing cloud computing services reported at least one data breach between 2020 and 2022.</li>
        <li><b>Limited Control and Flexibility </b>Cloud infrastructure is controlled by the provider, giving users limited control over their data and applications.</li>
        <li><b>Cost Concerns </b>While cloud computing can offer cost savings by enabling small businesses to access high-quality services without spending much money, the costs can increase if usage spikes or the provider raises their prices.</li>
        <li><b>Vendor Lock in</b>Businesses or users may become dependent on a specific vendor and need help to switch to a different provider, potentially impacting their operating efficiency and workflow.</li>
